# 📍 RollCallParentAppV2

RollCallParentAppV2 is a sleek React Native application that leverages the power of [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-maps/react-native-maps) and [@gorhom/bottom-sheet](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet). The application is designed to allow for interactive selection of map markers, where each marker unfolds a detailed view of its information via an expandable bottom sheet.
